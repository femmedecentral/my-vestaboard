My [Vestaboard](https://docs.vestaboard.com/read-write) setup.

This currently cycles through and does one of the following:
- Generates a random haiku using [ChatGPT](https://github.com/openai/openai-node)
- Shows today's weather using the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)
- Shows some stock/BTC prices from [Yahoo Finance](https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2)
