This currently cycles through and does one of the following:

## Generates a random haiku using [ChatGPT](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) e.g. here's one about my [cat](http://tigri.cat)
   ![haiku](screenshots/haiku.jpg)

## Shows today's weather using the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)
   ![weather](screenshots/weather.jpg)

## Shows some stock/BTC prices from [Yahoo Finance](https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2)
